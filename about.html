    <h3>What do we do?</h3>
    <p>We aim to sharpen our readers' views of the world through giving the cold truth about the post-apocolyptic world, regardless of good or bad.</p>
    <h3>Why can't we write about something nice?</h3>
    <p>We write about what we believe is important. Right now, there is more bad than good in the world. We want to make sure that are readers are aware of this.</p>
    <h3>Why do you hate Mayor McDonough so much?</h3>
    <p>I discuss him in my <a href="index.html">latest article</a>, but along with this I like some other people in Diamond City find his refusal to have kidnappings investigated very worrying. Who does he really work for?</p>
